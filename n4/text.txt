 [Verse 1: Dakota Jerns]
Never thought it would end up quite like this
Drowning deep in a world that I won't miss
If you wanna know the truth I've played this part for far too long
Lose a little more, gain a little back 'til I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus: Dakota Jerns]
Will this hurt me like it should?

[Chorus: Dakota Jerns]
Did it take from you
Everything like it did from me?
Never feeling good enough
Truth be told it's just my luck
Did it take from you
Everything like it did from me?
Well I can't make it on my own
(And I can't decide if we're even)

[Verse 2: Josey Scott, Josey Scott & Dakota Jerns]
You should realize when there's a heart of my size
I've been hostilely infiltrated by your venomous pack of lies
You could never hide, God only knows that I've tried
With every secret that you buried always there in your eyes
I told you so many times but you could never surmise
How I could always figure you out almost every time
I treated you like a prize, for you I'm ready to die
And when I tell you all these things you just look at me and smile
I gave you all of the things and how much joy did it bring?
Then you treated me like I'm nothing, gave you everything
A million different dreams, a million different things
But hurtin' people hurt people when it's not what it seems
[Chorus: Dakota Jerns]
Did it take from you
Everything like it did from me?
Never feeling good enough
Truth be told it's just my luck
Did it take from you
Everything like it did from me?
Well I can't make it on my own
(And I can't decide if we're even)

[Instrumental Break: Dakota Jerns]
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhhh
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhhh

[Chorus: Dakota Jerns, Josey Scott, Dakota Jerns & Josey Scott]
Did it take from you
Everything like it did from me?
Never feeling good enough
Truth be told it's just my luck (it's just my luck)
Did it take from you
Everything like it did from me?
Well I can't make it on my own
(And I can't decide if we're even)

[Outro: Dakota Jerns]
(Just my luck, just my luck)
(Just my luck, just my luck)
